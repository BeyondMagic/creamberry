# Description
#   Button to open a sidebar, it doesn't work yet
# 
# TODO
#   Label for power in Linux
#   Some commands that the sidebar will be able to use with password is
#     shutdown -h now ; shutdown
#     shutdown -r now ; reboot
#     command to suspend
# 
# Note
#   It's just a label for now, I will create clickable button
#   When I find a minimalist siderbar for Linux
#   As for right now, there's no sidebar at all :(
# 
#   Maybe one day I'll create one
#   But that it'll take long time because I want to create it
#   in C++
